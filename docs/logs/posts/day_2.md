## Work Done

- Fought with environment setup again ðŸ˜¢.

## WIP

- Change of plan again.
    - Don't want to fork `diffusion_policy` $\to$ temporarily use git submodule instead for reproduction purposes.
    - Colab notebook is almost a self-contained training + evaluation code. Adopt that but instead structure it into `tiny_dp` python submodule.
