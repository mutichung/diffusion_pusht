## Work Done

- Dataset analysis: played with both versions of dataset in `data_analysis.ipynb`.
- `diffusion_policy`
    - Successfully installed and imported as a package after being patched with necessary `__init__.py` files.
    - Understood success rate and metrics and how evaluation works.

## WIP

- Still figuring out how this repository should look like. Feel like I'd only need some basic python scripts to launch the training and evaluation jobs. Then why bother installing the original repo?

## TODO

- Look into colab notebooks.
- Training understanding
    - Policy input/output.
    - How is a diffusion model trained?
    - Hyperparameters.
- Evaluation understanding: how does validation work?
- PushT environment: compare it to `lerobot/gym-pusht`.
- Data preprocessing
    - How image and low-dimension tasks utilize data.
